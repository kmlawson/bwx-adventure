"Hello there, I am the one and only Meng Shen, the master cook. My food
is the best medicine for an ailing body. 

Here, I used to cook food from all manner of meats from ducks to camels,
but when I asked Mengzi for a little help, that pretentious scoundrel
told me, 'Gentlemen cannot bear to see animals die if they have seen them
living. If they hear their cries of suffering, they cannot bear to eat their
flesh. Hence, gentlemen keep their distance from the kitchen.'

So, you know what I did? We went full on vegetarian cuisine: no cries or 
suffering here. And yet, for some reason, I still get no help from Mengzi!"

He goes back to work.

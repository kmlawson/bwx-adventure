# Hall of Sages
A text adventure and puzzle for my nephew based on excellent python module bwx-adventure by SF Brightworks. 

The main file is sage.py that contains all the details for the game. Creating this game was a fun exercise, mostly to teach myself some Python. Looking back at it, there are a million ways this could be optimized and improved, especially as I was coding this blind by copying ideas from bwx-adventure and only after completion reading a bit more about how classes etc. work in Python.
